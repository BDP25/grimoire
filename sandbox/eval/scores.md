# Evaluation Scores

| ID | Question | Score (LLM Only) | Score (LLM + RAG) | Comment |
|----|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | What is a markdown file? | 9 | 1 | Answer A is a comprehensive and well-explained answer. Answer B is completely useless as it only contains the prompt. |
| 2 | What is the difference between Flask and FastAPI? | 9 | 1 | ** Answer A (LLM Only) provides a comprehensive and accurate comparison of Flask and FastAPI, covering key aspects like performance, data validation, documentation, and asynchronous programming. It's well-structured and easy to understand. Answer B is useless because it only contains the prompt. |
| 3 | How can I handle CORS in Flask? | 9 | 9 | Both answers are very good and provide a clear and concise explanation of how to handle CORS in Flask using the Flask-CORS extension. They both include installation instructions, basic usage examples, and configuration options. The LLM-only answer is slightly better because it is more complete and provides more context. The RAG answer is good, but it is missing some of the details that are included in the LLM-only answer. |
